                    <p>     
                            • Commissioned artwork can be freely used for personal use, if you post the artwork please credit me! :)
                        <br>• Commissions are NOT to be used for commercial purposes by anyone, except me the artist.
                        <br>• Once you receive the finished artwork, you are free to make edits to the artwork without having to ask for my permission. Do not remove any signatures or other crediting features if they are present!
                        <br>• I am not responsible for any loss of artwork after the commission is done. You may ask if I have copies but I cannot guarantee I will.

                        <br>• Chargebacks will result in you being banned from taking commissions from me. I will warn other artists if you make a chargeback.

            <p>
                    • Try to be precise with exactly what you want, including any desired changes.
                <br>• Before I continue onto the next stages of the commission, confirm that you don't want anymore changes! I can't go back to a previous stage if I'm on the next one!

            <p>
                • Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice.
                <br>• An in progress commission is only subject to the term version it was accepted on. So you don't have to worry about terms changing in the middle of a commission.
